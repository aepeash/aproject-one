    <h1>T-Series</h1>
    <p>
    Super Cassettes Industries Private Limited, doing business as T-Series, is an Indian music record label and film production company founded
    by Gulshan Kumar in 1983. It is primarily known for Bollywood music soundtracks and Indi-pop music. As of 2014, T-Series is India's
    largest music record label, with up to a 35% share of the Indian music market, followed by Sony Music India and Zee Music.

    Kumar, initially a fruit juice seller in Delhi, founded T-Series to sell pirated Bollywood songs, before the company eventually
    began producing new music. Their breakthrough came with the soundtrack for the 1988 Bollywood blockbuster Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak,
    composed by Anand-Milind, written by Majrooh Sultanpuri, and starring Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla, which became one of the best-selling
    Indian music albums of the 1980s, with over 8 million sales. They eventually became a leading music label with the release of
    Aashiqui (1990), composed by Nadeemâ€“Shravan, which sold 20 million copies and became the best-selling Indian soundtrack album of all time.
    However, Gulshan Kumar was murdered by the Mumbai mafia syndicate D-Company in 1997. Since then, T-Series has been led by his son
    Bhushan Kumar and younger brother Krishan Kumar.
