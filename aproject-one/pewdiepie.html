    <h1><a href="https://twitter.com/pewdiepie">PewDiePie</a></h1>
    <p>Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg[5] (/ˈʃɛlbɜːrɡ/ SHEL-burg; Swedish: [ˈfeːlɪks ²ɕɛlːbærj] (About this soundlisten);
         born 24 October 1989), known online as PewDiePie (/ˈpjuːdipaɪ/ PEW-dee-py), is a Swedish YouTuber,
        comedian and video game player-commentator, best known for his YouTube video content, which has mainly
        consisted of Let's Play commentaries, vlogs, and comedic formatted shows.
    </p>
    <p>Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, Kjellberg originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology
        management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. In 2010, during his time at the university,
        he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, he dropped out of Chalmers after
        losing interest in his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship
        with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel.
        In order to fund his videos, Kjellberg began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and worked at a hot dog stand.
        Kjellberg soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>On 15 August 2013, Kjellberg became the most-subscribed user on YouTube, being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by YouTube Spotlight.
        After regaining the top position on 23 December 2013 the channel has now amassed over 85 million subscribers as of February 2019.
        From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg's channel held the distinction of being the most-viewed YouTube channel.
        As of February 2019, the channel has received over 20 billion video views, ranking as the 8th-most viewed on the platform.
    </p>

    <p>Kjellberg's most noted YouTube content includes his Let's Play-styled video game commentaries, particularly of the horror genre.
        Many of his early videos consisted of him expressively reacting to the frightening elements of horror games, although he shortly
        broke his focus away from horror and played games of varying genres. While maintaining a focus on video game commentaries, Kjellberg
        began incorporating comedic vlogs into his content output with an increasing frequency. In the mid-to-late 2010s, Kjellberg began
        producing formatted vlogs that had a concentration on Internet culture and interactivity with his audience. His content has been
        praised as genuine and unfiltered, but also received as abrasive, and in some cases, met with controversy. As a result of an early
        2017 controversy regarding allegations of anti-Semitism in several of Kjellberg's videos, Maker Studios—the multi-channel network (MCN)
        he was signed to—ended their partnership with him. While he criticised the coverage of the situation and defended his content as jokes
        that were taken out of context, he conceded its offensiveness.
    </p>
    <p>The prevailing nickname used by media outlets for Kjellberg's fanbase is the "Bro Army", although Kjellberg has also referred
        to his fanbase as "Squad Fam", "nine-year-olds" and "fourteen-year-olds". Kjellberg has raised money for charities, encouraging his
        audience to donate to charity drives. Due to his popularity, Kjellberg's coverage of indie games has created an Oprah effect, boosting
        sales for titles he plays. In 2016, Time named him one of "The World's 100 Most Influential People". Kjellberg lives in Brighton with
        his fiancée, Italian Internet personality and fashion designer Marzia Bisognin.
